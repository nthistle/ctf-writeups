# picoCTF 2021

For this year's picoCTF, I played with GreyHat, GT's cybersecurity club, since I'm not in highschool anymore / eligible for prizes. Mostly as practice for club members though, since highschool-level CTFs tend to have good problems for beginners.

I focused on the cryptography questions, since that's my "specialty" these days: I swept the entire category (originally I just did a few to show people in GreyHat, but I ended up getting caught up and felt the need to solve them all). I can't speak for the other categories, but overall I felt the crypto was pretty lame this year. About half of them were almost direct copies of questions from previous years / CTFs, and almost all the remaining questions were either guessy or find-the-paper challenges.
